# Downscaled Modeling from the ECCO-Darwin State Estimate

This set of model configurations are formulated to run regional, downscaled ocean models coupled with biogeochemistry. The models are builts on the [MITgcm](https://github.com/MITgcm/MITgcm) using the [darwin3](https://github.com/darwinproject/darwin3) fork which implements biogeochemical processes.

The "parent model" from which all regional models are generated is the [ECCO-Darwin](https://github.com/MITgcm-contrib/ecco_darwin) state estimate. For more details about this simulation see [Carroll et al 2020](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019MS001888).
